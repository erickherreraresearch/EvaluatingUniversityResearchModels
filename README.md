To use the neural network model for Sustainability-focused Research Model Evaluation, you will need to download the files:
1. three_hidden_model22-23-25.zip
2. Evaluation.R
3. sample-data.csv

All three files should be in the same directory on the computer where you want to use them. Place the data from the 26-question university survey in the file sample-data.csv. Finally, run the Evaluation.R file.
Consider citing the articles from which this model is derived:
